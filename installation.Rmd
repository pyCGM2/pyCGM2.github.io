## RECOMMANDED PC CONFIGURATION 

pyCGM2 works fine on a PC following [Vicon's specifications](https://www.vicon.com/faqs)  for Nexus 2.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">

Notice Vicon recommands a Windows7-64-bits PC but Vicon-Nexus was compiled on a 32bits system. 

Therefore, if you need Vicon compatiblity and working with python operations from Vicon-Nexus, **you need to install 32-bits python packages only**

</div>


## REQUIRED  PYTHON ENVIRONNMENT 


pyCGM2 was designed according this diagram :
<center>
  <img src="diagrams/diagramPyCGM2.png"><br>
</center>

pyCGM2 was coded in  **python 2.7**

pyCGM2 Code requires common scientifical python packages : 
 * numpy
 * scipy
 * matplotlib
 * pandas

These packages are provided by most of python suite (Anaconda, pythonxy, canopy).<br> 
**We recommmand the use of [Anaconda2 (32bits)](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)**


### Third party open source libraries

In addition to common scientifical package, pyCGM2 needs both motion analysis-dedicated packages : [openma](https://openma.org) an [btk](https://github.com/Biomechanical-ToolKit/BTKCore).

Notice openMA is an evolution of Btk. Future release of pyCGM2 will be probably based on openMA only.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
Both pre-built packages of Btk and openMA are embedded in pyCGM2 ( folder third party), It's no use installing them
</div>

## INSTALLATION

**Preliminary : ** if you dont already have a python suite, like Anaconda : Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Then, 

 1. Download and unzip last release of  pyCGM2 from [github](https://github.com/pyCGM2/pyCGM2/releases)
 2. **[Optional - if you are a Vicon Nexus 2 user]**. <br> 
 Edit file : `pyCGM2\CONFIG` and indicate absolute locations :<br>
```python
NEXUS_SDK_WIN32 = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Vicon/Nexus2.5/SDK/Win32'
NEXUS_SDK_PYTHON = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Vicon/Nexus2.5/SDK/Python'
PYTHON_NEXUS = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vicon\\Nexus2.5\\Python'
```
 3. Open a MS-DOS console and go to pyCGM2 folder containing `setup.py`
 4. Type `pip install -e .` <br> This command checks your environment and put a link in your python path ( generally `Lib\site-packages`) toward your pyCGM2 folder.


if you want to keep in touch with early development, use a versioning software andreplace step 1 by : 


 * Install a versionning sofware (SourceTree, gitHub desktop,...)  
 * Clone the https adress from github in your versionning software



### Check your configuration

 * Open a python console
 * Type this snippet:
```python
  import pyCGM2
  pyCGM2.pyCGM2_CONFIG.checkConfig()
```

pyCGM2 is ready to use if you obviously get no error messages.<br>
