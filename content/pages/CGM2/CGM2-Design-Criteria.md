Title: Design Criteria
Slug: CGM2-Design-Criteria

The overall philosophy of the CMG 2.i project is to develop a model that preserves the strengths of the original model while addressing its weaknesses.

Nine *design criteria* have been formulated. The new model should:

1.	provide a **standard** method of data capture which is **easy**, **quick** and **robust** to use requiring a **minimum of biomechanical knowledge or special training** of the gait analyst.
2.	be **widely applicable** (with a minimum of variations) to adults and children (above the age of 5) with a range of different neuromusculoskeletal pathologies or none.
3.	provide **reproducible results** within and between gait analysts and across different clinical services.
4.	incorporate output of metrics specifically for **quality assurance purposes**.
5.	be **biomechanically rigorous** exploiting a state of the art knowledge of biomechanical modelling.
6.	be **validated rigorously** to conform with demands of modern clinical governance structures and the requirement for evidence based practice.
7.	be **transparent** allowing the user to understand the methodology at a number of different levels including full access to the underlying code.
8.	be as **backwards compatible** as possible.
9.	provide a **platform for future development**.
