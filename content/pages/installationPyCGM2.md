 * With the Window file explorer, go to your downloaded file and unzip it
 * Double click on **installer.bat** :

Eventually, the pyCGM2 package will be placed into the dedicated folder of any python libraries (i.e *YOUR_PYTHON_CORE_PATH\Lib\site-packages*).
The installer will create a new pyCGM2 folder in **c:/programData** gathering all settings.   

**For Vicon user only,** the installer will copy convenient nexus files (i.e. vst or pipelines) into the folder **C:/Users/Public/Documents/Vicon/Nexus2.x**
