Nexus proposes different gap filling methods. An approach published in Journal of Biomechanics, by Burke and Lasenby give accurate results.

The proposed method is based on **Low dimensional Kalman Filter**.


A concrete explanation of the algorithm can be found in this [post](articles/kalmanGapFilling.html)
