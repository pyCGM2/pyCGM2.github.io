Title: Definitions
Slug: CGM-Definitions

The original descriptions of the CGM referred to it as “a data collection and reduction technique” ([Davis, 1981](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-9457(91%2990046-Z)) and an "an algorithm for computing lower extremity joint motion" ([Kadaba, 1990](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jor.1100080310)). There is a strong argument that, as originally described, the CGM, is not actually a biomechanical model. This page thus aims to describe the concepts in a manner which is consistent with both the original description and a contemporary understanding of biomechanical modelling.

The mode is best described in four stages:
<ul>
  <li> Overview of the [basic kinematic chain](/pages/CGM-Chain.html) of segments.</li>
  <li>[Definition of the segments](/pages/CGM-Segments.html) in terms of the underlying anatomy.</li>
  <li>[Description of placement of markers](/pages/CGM-Markers.html) consistent with the anatomical segment definitions.</li>
  <li>Description of [model outputs](/pages/CGM-Outputs.html).</li>
  <li>[Variants](/pages/CGM-Variants.html).</li>.
</ul>

Proceed to [overview of kinematic chain](/pages/CGM-Chain.html).
