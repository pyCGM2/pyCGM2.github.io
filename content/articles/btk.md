Summary: Python Btk cheat sheet


**Biomechanical ToolKit (Btk)** is an efficient cross-platform library for dealing with the c3d format especially. There are plenty of convenient methods allowing **to read marker**, event,  or analog signals.
You can also **append signals into the c3d of making your own c3d** from scratch.


I gather in this cheat sheet, different snippets for helping developpers to understand Btk concepts and starting coding in Python.

Check out the [Btk website](http://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io) for finding out more.

Besides, I draw your attention [Btk evolved to be a bigger projet ](http://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/news/2016/08/29/btk-evolution/). [OpenMA](http://openma.org/) is the new project name. Internal concepts changed so to enlarge applications with different kind of biomechanical signals

I have promised a sheet cheat on OpenMA to the openMA developer.

Keep in touch.
