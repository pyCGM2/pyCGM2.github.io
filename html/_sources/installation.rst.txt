Installation
==============

.. warning::

    **I put Instructions in the pycgm2 website. It no worth adding it in sphinx** 

Recommanded PC
-------------------------------------------

pyCGM2 works fine on a PC following `Vicon's specifications <https://www.vicon.com/faqs>`_ for Nexus 2.

.. warning::

    Notice Vicon recommands a Windows7-64-bits PC but Vicon-Nexus was compiled on a 32bits system.

    Therefore, if you need Vicon compatiblity and working with python operations from Vicon-Nexus, **you need to install 32-bits python packages only**


Required python environment
-------------------------------------------

pyCGM2 was designed according this diagram :

.. image:: _static\image\diagramPyCGM2.png

pyCGM2 was coded in  **python 2.7**

pyCGM2 Code requires common scientifical python packages :
 * numpy
 * scipy
 * matplotlib
 * pandas

These packages are provided by most of python suite (Anaconda, pythonxy, canopy).

.. note::

    We recommmand the use of `Anaconda2 (32bits) <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_


Third party open source libraries
-----------------------------------------------

In addition to common scientifical packages, pyCGM2 needs both motion analysis-dedicated packages : `Openma <https://openma.org>`_  and
`Btk <https://github.com/Biomechanical-ToolKit/BTKCore>`_.

Notice openMA is an evolution of Btk. **Future release of pyCGM2 will be probably based on openMA only**.


.. note::

    Both pre-built packages of Btk and openMA are embedded in pyCGM2 ( folder third party). *It's no use installing one of them*.


Installation instructions
-----------------------------------------------


**Preliminary:** if you dont already have a python suite, like Anaconda : you need installing `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_

Then,

1. Download and unzip last release of  pyCGM2 from [github](https://github.com/pyCGM2/pyCGM2/releases)
2. **[Optional - if you are a Vicon Nexus 2 user]**.

Edit file : *pyCGM2\CONFIG.py* and indicate absolute locations :

  .. code-block:: python

    NEXUS_SDK_WIN32 = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Vicon/Nexus2.5/SDK/Win32'
    NEXUS_SDK_PYTHON = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Vicon/Nexus2.5/SDK/Python'
    PYTHON_NEXUS = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vicon\\Nexus2.5\\Python'

3. Open a MS-DOS console and go to pyCGM2 folder containing *setup.py*
4. Type *pip install -e .* ( don't forget the sign .)

This command checks your environment and put a link in your python path ( generally *Lib\site-packages*) toward your pyCGM2 folder.


.. note::

    if you want to keep in touch with early development, use a versioning software and replace step 1 by :

    * Install a versionning sofware (SourceTree, gitHub desktop,...)
    * Clone the https adress from github in your versionning software
